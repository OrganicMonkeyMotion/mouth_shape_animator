# Mouth Shape Animator

http://organicmonkeymotion.wordpress.com (finally he gives something back!)

This Blender add-on allows you to import mouth shape timings from a JSON file, generated by RLPS, a folder full of mouth shape images, and then animate the mouth shapes over time.

You need https://blendermarket.com/products/rhubarb-lipsync-ng as this generates the required json file from an audio file.

## Installation
1. Download the `mouth_shape_animator.zip` file.
2. Open Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
3. Click **Install...**, select the `mouth_shape_animator.zip` file, and click **Install Add-on**.
4. Enable the add-on in the Add-ons preferences panel.

## Usage
After installation, you can find the Mouth Shape Animator in the **RLPS** tab in the properties panel.

Then three simple steps, being:

1. Essentionly you need a folder (somewhere) of mouth shaps (A..H,X), with transparent backgrounds of course.

2. Yawl also need to find the json file that RLSP generates from your audio file.

3. Then just press the "Import Mouth Shapes" button.

The code'll create a collection called "Mouth_Shapes" the add the images from the image folder, set a shader up for each material, then run over the timing information to animate the HIDE/SHOW of the images on the timeline (based upon those in the json file generated by RLSP).

Then once the images are set up, they'll have actions assigned (AACTION..HACTION,XACTION), and you simply use the drop downs, in the "RLSP: Que mapping and baking" tab to select and assign the the automatically created action.
