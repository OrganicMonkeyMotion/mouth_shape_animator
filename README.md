This Blender add-on allows you to import mouth shapes from a JSON file, generated by RLPS, and animate the mouth shapes over time.

You need https://blendermarket.com/products/rhubarb-lipsync-ng as this generates the required json file from an audio file.

2. Open Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
3. Click **Install...**, select the `mouth_shape_animator.zip` file, and click **Install Add-on**.
4. Enable the add-on in the Add-ons preferences panel.
