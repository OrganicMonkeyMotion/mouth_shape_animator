# Mouth Shape Animator

http://organicmonkeymotion.wordpress.com (finally he gives something back!)

This Blender add-on allows you to import mouth shapes from a JSON file, generated by RLPS, and animate the mouth shapes over time.

You need https://blendermarket.com/products/rhubarb-lipsync-ng as this generates the required json file from an audio file.

## Installation
1. Download the `mouth_shape_animator.zip` file.
2. Open Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
3. Click **Install...**, select the `mouth_shape_animator.zip` file, and click **Install Add-on**.
4. Enable the add-on in the Add-ons preferences panel.

## Usage
After installation, you can find the Mouth Shape Animator in the **RLPS** tab in the properties panel.

Essentionly you need a folder (somewhere) of mouth shaps (A..H,X), with transparent backgrounds of course.

Then once the images are set up, they'll have actions assigned (AACTION..HACTION,XACTION), and you simply use the drop downs to select the automatically created action.
